# Example for React

Since the routing library is a complex integration package that requires a server for SSR and work
with the History API, Live Preview is unavailable. However, you can download ready-made examples.

### Preview

<CodeView framework="react" :tree="examplesTree" />

### Download

```shell
npx degit dkazakov8/reactive-route/examples/react react-example
cd react-example
npm install
```

Then choose the mode and reactivity system to run:

- `npm run mobx` — CSR (client-side rendering only) for MobX
- `npm run observable` — CSR (client-side rendering only) for Observable
- `npm run ssr-mobx` — SSR for MobX
- `npm run ssr-observable` — SSR for Observable

Note that in this example, wrapping components in `observer` is handled by the ESBuild bundler. 
In your own projects, do not forget to follow the relevant <Link to="integration/react">integration</Link> guide.
