This feature depends on your bundler&#39;s ability to generate separate chunks. Microfrontends are also technically supported, though their implementation varies greatly from project to project, so Reactive Route does not provide a boilerplate architecture for them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modular Data Integration</strong>: You can export any data from pages, and it is accessible through several built-in methods like <code>beforeEnter</code> and <code>beforeSetPageComponent</code>. This is essential for SSR with modular/domain/per-page stores and serves as a powerful Dependency Injection mechanism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>: An easy-to-use mechanism for pre-rendering pages on the server side with optional data loading and optional clearing of irrelevant query parameters from the URL.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strict Validation</strong>: Every dynamic parameter from the URL (e.g., <code>/page/:id/:mode</code>) and every query parameter must have a validator, preventing invalid routes and improving application robustness.</p></li><li><p><strong>TypeScript Integration</strong>: Comprehensive TypeScript support for routes, dynamic parameters, and query parameters, providing excellent DX with autocomplete. No more redirects to untyped strings or manual searching during refactoring.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architect&#39;s Dream</strong>: The router is a flat, separate layer that works with any framework – or none at all. No more routing logic buried inside UI components and templates. No need for AST parsing of markup to find routes, and no polluted component trees. There are also no requirements for folder structure or file naming.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stability</strong>: The library is backed by over 500 unit and E2E tests which run the <a href="/reactive-route/examples/react.html">examples</a> in real browsers.
